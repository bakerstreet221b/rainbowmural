    <h2>About Rainbow Mural</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="about">
    <p>Rainbow Mural is a website to explore street art around the world.
    We seek to make the exeptional art work that is street art available to a wider audience.
    Users can like their favorite photos and engage in conversations with other users.
    <br>
    <br>
    All the street art photos are scraped from Flickr. Every single one of these photos contains a geo tag with a latitude and longitude, indicating where it was taken.
    This geo tag is then used to group the photos by location and display them on a map.
    MySQL Databases are used to store users, likes of photos and comments.

    <br>
    Rainbow Mural was launched in November 2013 by web developer Thereza Scherrer. I strive to make an easy to use website with minimal design to best showcase the street art.

    <p>Hello, I am Thereza and I am looking for a job as web developer.
      I started to teach myself programming on Codecademy and fell in love with it.
      I moved to San Francisco in October 2013 to attend a programming bootcamp, <a href="http://codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a>.</p>

    <p>I built this project with PHP, jQuery and MySQL.
      For the pictures, I used the flickr API and I worked with the Google API to display all the maps.</p>
