# Rainbow Mural

http://www.rainbowmural.com/application/index.php

This is my first PHP project. It is my graduation project from the Coding Dojo bootcamp. 

Directroy structure: All the PHP code is in the application and system folders. 
The system folder has all class definitions and all SQL queries, and the application folder has all HTML code and all presentation stuff. 

Javascript and CSS is all in the assets folder.
