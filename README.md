# Rainbow Mural

http://www.rainbowmural.com/application/index.php

This is my first PHP project. It is my graduation project from the Coding Dojo bootcamp. 

Directroy structure: 
- All the PHP code is in the application and system folders.
- The system folder has all class definitions and all SQL queries.
- The application folder has all HTML code and all presentation code. 
- Javascript and CSS is all in the assets folder.
